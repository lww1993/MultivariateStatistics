# MultivariateStatistics
It includs slides, codes, data for my MVA classes.

1-data are mainly from the website of the book called "多元统计分析及R语言建模" by "王斌会";
ISLR data are from the book "Introduction to Statistical Learning with R"

The codes orginally also belong to the book, but have been commented and modified greatly by myself; 

The slides have been created by myself completely.

Welcome to get anything useful from the above. I will feel grateful and honoured if you refer to me when getting any help from it.
